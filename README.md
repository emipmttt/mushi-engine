## Introduction

Mushi Engine is designed to simplify the game development process by providing intuitive tools for world building, character creation, and scripting with JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Mushi Engine offers a straightforward approach to crafting engaging games.

## Story

A few years ago, I embarked on a journey to learn game development with JavaScript. Despite the availability of existing JavaScript game engines, I found myself wanting a more streamlined and accessible tool. This led me to create Mushi Engineâ€”a simple game engine that lowers the barrier to entry, allowing anyone to start building games without needing extensive knowledge. This project is a passion project, and I am committed to continuously enhancing it over time.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mushi-engine.git
cd mushi-engine
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development

To run the project in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This command starts a local development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the application. The server supports hot-reloading, so any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the page.

### Production Build

To compile and minify the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates optimized and minified files suitable for deployment. The output will be located in the `dist` directory.

### Linting

To lint and fix files:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command runs the linter to check for code style issues and automatically fixes them where possible.

## Configuration

You can customize the project configuration to suit your needs. Refer to the [Vue CLI Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/) for detailed information on available options and settings.
